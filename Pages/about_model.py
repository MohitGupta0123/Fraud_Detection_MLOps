    ## Model Overview
    This fraud detection model is built as a **custom pipeline** that includes:

    1. **Feature Engineering**  
       - Interaction: `Category x PaymentMethod`  
       - Ratio: `paymentMethodAgeDays / accountAgeDays`  
       - Binning: `accountAgeDays` into new/medium/old  
       - Time Feature: Categorizing `localTime` into time-of-day segments  

    2. **Preprocessing**
       - Imputation for missing values (median for numeric, mode for categorical)  
       - One-hot encoding for categorical variables  
       - Log transformation for skewed numerical features  
       - Scaling (StandardScaler for skewed features, MinMaxScaler for symmetric features)  

    3. **Resampling**
       - **SMOTE** used to handle class imbalance (fraudulent cases are rare).  

    4. **Model Training**
       - Trained using **Logistic Regression** (can be switched to RandomForest/XGBoost).  
       - Evaluated on multiple hold-out datasets for robustness.

    ## Threshold Tuning
    To improve recall and precision trade-off for fraud detection:
    - **Optimal Threshold (found during training):** `0.8370`  
    - At this threshold:  
      - **Precision = 0.955**  
      - **Recall = 0.991**

    This threshold ensures that the **model catches nearly all fraud cases** (high recall) while keeping **false positives low** (high precision).

    ## MLOps Implementation
    This repository demonstrates **end-to-end MLOps practices**:
    - **Experiment Tracking:** All training experiments tracked using **MLflow** (parameters, metrics, artifacts).  
    - **Containerization:** Model and FastAPI inference service **Dockerized** for portability.  
    - **Kubernetes Deployment:** FastAPI container deployed on **Minikube** for scalable local testing.  
    - **Monitoring:** Integrated **Prometheus + Grafana** to monitor API metrics (latency, request count, status codes).  

    This setup ensures **reproducibility, scalability, and observability** of the entire ML lifecycle.
